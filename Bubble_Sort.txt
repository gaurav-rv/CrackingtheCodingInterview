How does Bubble Sort work?
> Start from the first element, compare the next element and swap. Then one less element needs to be compared

EG: (bad example but you get the point): 
> 	3,2,5,7,6
>	2,3,5,7,6
>	2,3,5,7,6
>	2,3,5,6,7

Runtime:
	Time:
		Worst case: O(n^2)
		avg case:	O(n^2)
	Space:
		 Worst case : O(1)
